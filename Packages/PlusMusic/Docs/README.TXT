The PlusMusic Adaptive Music Platform (AMP) is a complete game music solution and a true platform for developers. 
AMP is designed for ease-of-use and virtually instant implementation into Unity and Unreal game engines. 
The AMP middleware enables you to connect your game project with the AMP Music Library of handpicked, 
artist-created tracks for quick and seamless adaptive music playback in your game.

If you don't already have a PlusMusic account, go to app.plusmusic.ai and click sign up. Access to AMP middleware 
including the web-based Dev Portal and the Unity/Unreal Plugins is free, and developers with titles in development 
can get unlimited access to watermarked tracks in the Music Library. 
For projects set for public release, we offer tiered pricing for music licensing that scales as your player community grows.

Music tracks from the Library are automatically analyzed and mapped into sections called Adaptive Music States (States) 
that can be triggered in-game. We use proprietary Machine Listening processing to identify States in the music according 
to criteria such as intensity, mood, and style. The full set of States that can be used in your game project 
are available as an Arrangement in the Dev Portal.

In your game engine project, you specify State triggering using our predefined prefabs, scripts, or blueprints. 
You can select transitions between States, add stingers, adjust volume and intensity. 
Through this workflow, you define an in-game adaptive playback structure for the music that is independent from the 
specific track that is playing. Once the in-game adaptive playback structure is set, any track from the AMP Music Library 
will conform and playback according to those instructions.

In addition to States, each track is separated into 4 layers or "stems" such as bass, drums, vocals, and top mix. 
The volume for each layer can be controlled independently. You can use the tracks in your project as a set game score, 
switch tracks from a predefined playlist, play them at random or even allow the player to choose which tracks to play at runtime.


We currently offer seven (7) State types for each song:

high_backing        High intensity exploration      Loop
low_backing         Low intensity exploration       Loop
backing_track       Mid intensity exploration       Loop
victory             Achievement                     Short duration one-shot
failure             Missed or failed objective      Short duration one-shot
highlight           High intensity stinger          Long duration one-shot or loop
lowlight            Low intensity stinger           Long duration one-shot or loop
